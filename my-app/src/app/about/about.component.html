                    Philippi Village is an old cement factory in Philippi. The Hub, has its main function to build entrepreneurs in South Africa and was given new life, re-purposed into an entrepreneurial and recreational/retail hub. 
                    The R120 million Hub, which had already leased over half of its office space before it was completed in mid-2015, was built within the old five-storey cement factory. Within its walls is office, event, conference and meeting space for the businesses and non-government organisations who rent here. But Philippi Village is more than its business Hub. In January 2016 a City library relocated to the buildingâ€™s ground floor, bringing over 5000 library users. On the one side of the village is the Container Walk, a series of shipping containers that works hand-in-hand with entrepreneurs by supplying local artists, designers and small business with innovative retail space. Philippi Village welcomed many businesses to utilise rental space and some of these businesses utilise the space to offer programmes to develop the community and give them a better future.
